# Roy

This is Roy. He is a ray tracer.

Roy is a pet project for me to learn Haskell. Do not expect to find good Haskell code in this repository.
The code mostly follows the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8?ie=UTF8&keywords=ray%20tracing%20in%20one%20weekend&qid=1463084374&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1).
